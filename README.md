# SolusForge

This is a repository of the different technical snapshots of the SolusForge system; each is a associated with a different publication, and are labeled appropriately with the venue in question.

Further details on each snapshot is included in the readme file in each of the individual folders.

In general, the outputs of each version of the system results in files in the [LDraw] (http://www.ldraw.org/) standard file format, which can then be loaded into the Lego CAD system of your choice, a list of which can be found [here] (http://www.ldraw.org/downloads-2/third-party-software.html).
